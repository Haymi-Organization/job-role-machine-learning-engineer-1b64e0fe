# Machine Learning Engineer Technical Assessment\n\nWelcome to your technical assessment for the Machine Learning Engineer position! This assessment is designed to evaluate your practical skills in machine learning, particularly in Python, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow, which are essential for our work in training models that can understand and generate native languages.\n\n## ‚è≥ Duration\nThis assessment is designed to be completed within **1 week**, with a suggested active working time of up to **72 hours**.\n\n## üöÄ Getting Started\n1.  **Fork this repository:** Create a copy of this repository under your GitHub account.\n2.  **Clone your forked repository:** Get a local copy on your machine.\n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/THIS_REPO_NAME.git\n    cd THIS_REPO_NAME\n    ```\n3.  **Create a new branch:** All your work should be done on a dedicated branch.\n    ```bash\n    git checkout -b feature/your-name-assessment\n    ```\n4.  **Explore the tasks:** Navigate to the `submissions/week-1/` directory. You will find `Instruction.md` files for each task. Read them carefully.\n\n## üéØ Your Goal\nComplete all **3 tasks** outlined in `submissions/week-1/` by implementing the required solutions in Python. Ensure your code is well-structured, tested, and documented.\n\n## üìã Evaluation Criteria\nYour submission will be evaluated based on the following aspects:\n\n*   **Code Quality (25%):** Readability, maintainability, adherence to best practices (e.g., PEP 8), modularity.\n*   **Testing (20%):** Presence and effectiveness of unit/integration tests, edge case handling.\n*   **Performance (20%):** Efficiency of algorithms, appropriate use of libraries, model training time and inference speed considerations.\n*   **Documentation (20%):** Clear comments, README files, explanations of design choices, setup instructions.\n*   **Accessibility (15%):** (In this context, it refers to the clarity and ease of understanding/using your code and models, rather than UI accessibility. E.g., clear API endpoints, easy-to-run scripts.)\n\n## üì• Submission Process\nOnce you have completed all tasks:\n1.  **Commit your changes:** Make sure all your code and documentation are committed to your feature branch.\n2.  **Push your branch to GitHub:**\n    ```bash\n    git push origin feature/your-name-assessment\n    ```\n3.  **Open a Pull Request (PR):** From your forked repository on GitHub, open a Pull Request targeting the `main` branch of the **original repository**. Please include a brief summary of your work and any assumptions made.\n\nWe look forward to reviewing your submission! Good luck!
