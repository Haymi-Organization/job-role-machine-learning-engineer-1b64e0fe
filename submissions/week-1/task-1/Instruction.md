# Week 1, Task 1: Text Preprocessing and Feature Extraction\n\n## ðŸŽ¯ Objective\nImplement robust data loading, cleaning, and basic feature extraction for text data, preparing it for machine learning models using Python and scikit-learn compatible methods.\n\n## ðŸ“‹ Requirements\n1.  **Data Loading:** Create a Python script (`task1.py`) that can load a provided (or simulated) dataset of text samples and their corresponding labels.\n    *   **Hint:** If no dataset is provided, simulate a small dataset (e.g., 100-200 sentences for two categories like "positive" and "negative" reviews).\n2.  **Text Cleaning:** Implement functions to clean the raw text data. This should include:\n    *   Converting text to lowercase.\n    *   Removing punctuation (e.g., using `string.punctuation`).\n    *   Removing numeric characters.\n    *   (Optional but recommended) Removing common stopwords (e.g., using `nltk.corpus.stopwords`).\n3.  **Feature Extraction:** Apply at least one feature extraction technique to convert the cleaned text into numerical features suitable for machine learning models.\n    *   **Requirement:** Use either `TfidfVectorizer` or `CountVectorizer` from `sklearn.feature_extraction.text`.\n    *   **Output:** The script should output the processed numerical features (e.g., as a NumPy array or Pandas DataFrame) and the corresponding labels.\n4.  **Documentation:** Provide comments in your code and a short `README.md` in the `submissions/week-1/task-1/` directory explaining your approach, how to run your script, and any design choices.\n5.  **Testing:** Include basic unit tests for your text cleaning functions to ensure they work as expected for various inputs.\n\n## ðŸ§ª Deliverables\n*   `task1.py`\n*   `README.md`\n*   (Optional) Test file, e.g., `test_task1.py`
