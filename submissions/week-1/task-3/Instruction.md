# Week 1, Task 3: Simple Prediction Endpoint\n\n## ðŸŽ¯ Objective\nDevelop a script or a very basic API endpoint that loads the trained model from Task 2 and provides predictions for new, unseen input text, demonstrating an end-to-end prediction flow.\n\n## ðŸ“‹ Requirements\n1.  **Model Loading:** Create a Python script (`task3.py`) that loads the pre-trained model and the `TfidfVectorizer`/`CountVectorizer` (if applicable) saved in Task 2 and Task 1 respectively.\n2.  **Prediction Function:** Implement a function that takes raw input text as an argument, performs the necessary preprocessing (using the logic from Task 1), applies the loaded feature extractor, and then uses the loaded model to make a prediction.\n3.  **Simple Interface:** Provide a simple way to test your prediction function:\n    *   **Option A (Script-based):** Allow users to input text via the console (e.g., `input()`) and display the prediction.\n    *   **Option B (Basic API - Recommended):** Implement a simple web endpoint (e.g., using Flask or FastAPI, even if not explicitly required, this demonstrates a valuable skill for an entry-level ML Engineer) that accepts text via a POST request and returns the prediction.\n4.  **Error Handling (Basic):** Consider basic error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., empty string). This is a 'beginner' task so extensive error handling is not expected, but some thought should be given to robustness.\n5.  **Documentation:** Provide comments in your code and update the `README.md` in the `submissions/week-1/task-3/` directory, explaining how to run your script/API and how to make predictions.\n\n## ðŸ§ª Deliverables\n*   `task3.py` (or multiple files if using Flask/FastAPI)\n*   `README.md`\n*   (Optional) `requirements.txt` listing dependencies for running your prediction endpoint.
